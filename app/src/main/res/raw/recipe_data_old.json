      "1.5 tbsp soy sauce",
      "1.5 tsp sugar"

    "recipeSteps": [
      "1. Combine dashi, mirin, sake, soy sauce in a bowl or a liquid measuring cup.",
      "2. Add sugar and mix all together until sugar is dissolved",
      "3. Thinly slice the onion and chop mitsuba (or green onion). Beat one egg in a small bowl (you will need to beat another egg when you work on the second batch).",
      "4. Slice the chicken thigh diagonally and cut into 1.5 inch (4 cm) pieces. I recommend using sogigiri cutting technique so the chicken will be equal thickness and create more surface area for fast cooking",
      "5. Typically Oyakodon is made per serving, using this Oyakodon Pan. This small pan lets you slide the finished dish over the rice bowl easily while the egg is set but still runny (in Japan, eggs are safe to eat raw). To demonstrate, I use an 8-inch (small) frying pan in this recipe. To cook one serving at a time, divide the ingredients in half (we'll have to make it twice if you don't have two pans). Alternatively, you can cook 2 servings together in a big pan.",
      "6. Add the onion in a single layer. Pour roughly ⅓ to ½ of the seasonings mixture (depending on the size of your frying pan, the amount may vary). Pour just enough sauce to cover the onion and chicken.",
      "7. Add half of the chicken on top of the onion. Make sure the onion and chicken are evenly distributed. Turn on the heat to medium heat and bring to a boil.",
      "8. Once boiling, lower the heat to medium-low heat. Skim off any foam or scum if you see any. Cover and cook for about 5 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink and onion is tender.",
      "9. Taste the broth and see if you need to adjust. Slowly and evenly drizzle the beaten egg over the chicken and onion. Cook covered on medium-low heat until the egg is done to your liking. Usually, Oyakdon in Japan is served with an almost set but runny egg.",
      "10. Add the mitsuba (or green onion) right before removing from the heat. Pour the chicken and egg on top of steamed rice and drizzle the desired amount of remaining sauce."

      "5. Cook for 30-40 minutes, partially cover, and stir every once in a while. If it starts to look dry, add some of the sauce from the carton, slowly , as you need it. Add the salt and pepper - I like a lot because I love salt on tomatoes.",
      "6. The final product should be a thick sauce that just looks like a whole lot of tomatoes stuck together - with very little to no juice, that is about 1-1 1/2 inches high.",
      "7. Crack open the eggs on top of the shakshuka, one by one, giving each their own space. The whites should overlap, but the yolk should be spaced about 4 fingerwidths from each other. My pan can fit 6-8 eggs very comfortably.",
      "Cover tightly with a lid and simmer for 20 minutes."
